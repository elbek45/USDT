## Risk Assessment

### High Risks 🔴

1. **No external security audit** → MUST DO before mainnet
2. **Low test coverage** → Increase to >80%

### Medium Risks 🟡

3. JWT refresh tokens not implemented → 1 day fix
4. In-memory nonces (need Redis) → 1 day migration
5. Some security vulnerabilities (High priority) → 2-3 days

### Low Risks 🟢

6. Linting warnings → Cleanup (3 hours)
7. Performance optimization → Already fast enough

**Overall Risk Level: MEDIUM** ⚠️
_Mitigated by: External audit + test coverage improvement_
